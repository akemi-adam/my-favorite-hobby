                <span class="text-pink-500 italic">My</span> favorite hobby is writing. And here it is writing in general. In short, I tend to write three kinds of things: codes, stories, and pages of my journal. So, I will tell you a little bit about each of these modes of writing that I practice and why every human being (decent people) should practice at least one of these three forms of writing.

                <p class="indent-8 text-justify text-xl first-letter:text-4xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:italic first-letter:text-pink-500">
                    <span class="text-pink-500 italic">Starting</span> with the most boring but most important of all: journal writing. Keeping a (manuscript) diary is literally having a historical document of your own; of course anything that tells about the history of someone or a people is a historical document, but a diary is something very important because it is where you will put all the frivolous things of your daily life, all the important things, feelings or even random thoughts. All of this acts as a kind of fragmentation of yourself, since a diary serves as a reflection of your soul and mind (distorted? Yes, but it still does).

                    <span class="text-pink-500 italic">Moreover</span>, the exercise of handwriting will always be being exercised and this can certainly help you in other contexts of your life.

                <h2 class="italic text-5xl text-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Code</h2>
                <p class="indent-8 text-justify text-xl first-letter:text-4xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:italic first-letter:text-pink-500">
                    T<span class="text-pink-500 italic">he</span> other way of writing is something more difficult if we think about the issue of practicality and that most people have an aversion to. I am talking of course about programming.
                </p>
                <p class="indent-8 text-justify text-xl first-letter:text-4xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:italic first-letter:text-pink-500">
                    <span class="text-pink-500 italic">Writing</span> code is something that has countless advantages, even for those who don't work with it.
                </p>
                <p class="indent-8 text-justify text-xl first-letter:text-4xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:italic first-letter:text-pink-500">
                    <span class="text-pink-500 italic"></span> of all, logical thinking will be stimulated a lot. Programming is logic, so you can practice a lot of the logic that is routinely used in everyday life.

                <p class="indent-8 text-justify text-xl first-letter:text-4xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:italic first-letter:text-pink-500">
                    <span class="text-pink-500 italic">The</span> other clear advantage is that because it is logic-based, you can create solutions to a lot of your everyday problems. Repetitive tasks can be reduced to a few files and lines of code; an example of this was a system I created in Java to automatically rename and move scanned files; this was extremely useful in my former job (I was an intern at CDS), where I needed to scan dozens of documents.
                </p>
                <p class="indent-8 text-justify text-xl first-letter:text-4xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:italic first-letter:text-pink-500">
                    A<span class="text-pink-500 italic">nd</span>, what I think is most important nowadays: programming is a door to the infinite possibilities that informatics provides. By starting to learn programming, you can learn more about how a computer works and use this to your advantage to have much faster and fluid navigation. Using the terminal (in Windows it is the CMD) will speed up a lot of the boring activities that we usually do in the file explorer. With a few commands you can compact a folder without even taking your hand off the keyboard (KEYBOARD > MOUSE).

                    F<span class="text-pink-500 italic">inally</span>, in fact my favorite hobby: writing. I could say many things about writing stories - horror stories, romance, sci-fi or even fanfics (after all, we all have to start with something, don't we?) - but since I am sleepy (sorry), all I will say is that the scariest thing about reality is that it is real; so write, since in words, imagination never dies.
